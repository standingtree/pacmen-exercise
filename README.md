# PacMen Exercise 
Factory for making and programmatically animating multiple pacmen, using starter html code from MITxPro.

### How to use: 
<ol>
  <li>Click "Add PacMan" button to add a new PacMan to the game. You can add as many as you would like.</li>
  <li>Click "Start Game / Speed Up" to start moving the PacMen around the screen. Click again to speed up the movement.</li>
</ol>

### Roadmap:
<ol>
  <li>Have PacMen spawn at random places on the page instead of just next to the start button.</li>
  <li>Add moving dots and "dot-eating" like in the actual game.</li>
</ol>
